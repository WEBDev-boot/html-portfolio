<h1>The Best Movies According to Angel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of the MCU all-time where they finally unite forces<br />
    to completly defeat Thanos.
</p>

<h3>The Old Guard</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Action/Adventure movie because of its story line, CGI efffects,c
    inmortality of the characters, and the great potential to become a Saga.<br />
    I am exited as I just found out they are working to release the second part in 2024.
</p>

<h3>Hercules 1997</h3>
<p>This was by far my favorite cartoon ever. It presented a magical mixture of music,<br />
    story line, and beautiful colors that conquered my attention and imagination.
